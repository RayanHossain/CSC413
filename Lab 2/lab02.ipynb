    "In this lab, we will build a neural network that can predict the next word\n",
    "in a sentence given the previous three. We will apply an idea called *weight sharing*\n",
    "to go beyond the multi-layer perceptrons that we discussed in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also solve this problem problem twice: once in numpy, and once\n",

    "The prediction task is not very interesting on its own, but in learning to predict\n",
    "subsequent words given the previous three, our neural networks will learn\n",
